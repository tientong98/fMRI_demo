**Task**: This dataset contains 25 subjects performing a dual-task propspective memory experiment. Participants were shown a series of words while pictures of faces and scenes were presented in the background. Participants performed an ongoing task while monitoring for a picture target (a particular face or a particular scene) to reappear. Each subject performed two versions of the task (WM-bias, EM-bias) in alternating runs of 15 trials. Each subject had 6 functional runs of 301 TRs. Between runs, participants were given a break during which the experimenter checked that the participant was comfortable and alert.

**Task diagram**: The dual-task experiment consisted a picture-target detection prospective memory task (“PM”) embedded in an ongoing lexical-decision task (“OG”). Half of the trials were WMbias trials (1-back lexical decisions and a small set of repeating homogeneous pictures) and half were EMbias trials (2-back lexical decisions and a large set of trial-unique heterogeneous pictures). Two-thirds of all trials included both tasks (“PM+OG”), and one-third did not require PM responses (“OG only”)
